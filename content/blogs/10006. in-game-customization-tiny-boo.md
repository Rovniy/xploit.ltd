### Customizing

Some games allow you to create your character from scratch, while others offer smaller changes to appearance or colors. Additionally, many games offer "skins" for characters to add in-game variety.

### Why?

Why is the ability to customize your character so important?

1) Players often want their playable character to represent them by making it look like themselves or by designing its appearance to match their personal preferences such as color, style, and makeup.

2) Many players enjoy customizing their characters, viewing it as a creative process where they can create a unique concept for their main game character.

3) Customization is a great way to add diversity to the gaming experience and make it more vibrant.

4) Having a selection of character skins can capture the interest of players who enjoy collecting in-game objects such as skins, frames, and styles.

5) Allowing for character customization can increase the audience's involvement in gameplay and create a personalized atmosphere based on a player's preferences.

Therefore, we decided to make our game customizable as well, with the intention of creating an enjoyable environment for our audience. Boo will be customizable with appearance and gameplay skins. Depending on which skin a player uses, Boo's abilities will change. There will also be various appearance options that do not directly affect the gameplay, to fulfill a creative part of our audience's journey and to give them different variations of Boo himself. Creating skins that alter gameplay for players hasn't been widely adopted, so we're experimenting with different ways to offer players an enjoyable in-game experience.

Additionally, we're developing more customization options. Players will be able to change their menu appearance to create a unique atmosphere for themselves;

Our team is now offering an added feature! You can now alter the appearance of your mascot. The mascot is Boo's tiny and adorable companion, who flies around and accompanies him on his exciting journey.
