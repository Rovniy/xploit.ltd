### About

Mobile gaming has changed a lot lately and has attracted players worldwide with its diverse range of genres. Platformers are one genre that has been around for a long time and still captivates players. These games challenge players to guide a character through levels filled with hurdles, enemies, and puzzles. In this article, we’ll give a short summary of the mechanics of our game, “Tiny Boo.” Homecoming is a platformer game we are currently developing. It combines traditional elements with inventive gameplay to provide a unique experience.

Before we discuss the mechanics of Tiny Boo: Homecoming, let’s review the basic principles that form the foundation of platformer games.

### Features

1) In platformer games, players control a character who can run, jump, and perform various actions. Success in these games depends on precise character control.
2) Platformer levels are made up of platforms, ladders, and various obstacles that players must traverse. They need to leap over pits, avoid enemies, and solve puzzles to progress.
3) Players collect power-ups to gain new abilities and items that can help them progress through levels. Furthermore, players can gather power-ups and other items like coins, health boosts, and weapons to aid their advancement in the game. Numerous platformer games showcase items that enhance a player’s abilities, grant extra health, or unlock special skills.
4) Moreover, as players progress, the challenges amplify, introducing new obstacles that demand advanced skills and strategic thinking to conquer.

### What is that

“Tiny Boo: Homecoming” is a mobile game that brings new ideas to the platformer style, while also keeping the elements of nostalgia that fans of the genre appreciate.

Some of the game’s notable mechanics include the central feature, which is based on our idea of creating a game where the world reacts to the character, instead of the character having to conform to the world. This means that when Boo reaches the end of a platform, he won’t just fall off, as you might expect. But we changed the usual design, causing the world to flip over with obstacles, terrain, etc. to prevent Boo from falling! Check out the demo below.

As Boo heads home, he will encounter numerous challenges, puzzles to solve, and fascinating enemies with intriguing mechanics. For instance, while traveling, Boo encounters a living plant that blocks his path, preventing him from proceeding. This plant must be fed so it can sleep, and we can continue our adventure.
