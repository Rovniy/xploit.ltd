### What about?

Tiny Boo: Homecoming is our young team’s first game. We decided to put a lot of emphasis on the visual part of the game, because we believe that the more elaborate the world is, the more interesting and pleasant it is for the player to immerse himself in it. The visual part of the game is one of the most important and should not be left without attention. It directly affects the audience's perception of what is going on, the perceived atmosphere and vibe.

We are keen on to create an exceptional art style for Tiny Boo: Homecoming. The level design and character sprites are handcrafted with precision and are made to evoke a sense of playfulness and marvel. Every corner and detail of the world is illustrated with our artists and designers, allowing players to get lost in its enchanting atmosphere.

The bright colors in the game make the world and its residents come alive. Every color, from the cozy, warm forest to the spooky glow of the mushroom locations, are made to Boo’s world feel complete, and the player can travel through it, diving into the atmosphere of different places.

Boo has a playful and cozy appearance, and the other characters, whether Boo's friends or enemies, have unique personalities that make for a delightful and memorable ensemble. We also putting a lot of effort in unfriendly forest creatures that make Boo’s way home more difficult but yet interesting, you can see one of those on the picture below.

### Lighting

As we know, lighting and ambiance's aesthetic choices are crucial in setting the game's tone. The play of shadows and light adds depth and mystery to the forest locations, making each of them feel unique and magical. This smart use of atmosphere improves the player's immersion in Boo's adventure. So, as you can see our team is making progress in developing the creative side of the game. Our designers and artists are fully committed to crafting an incredible fantasy world that you can explore and have adventures in.
