### About

Having opened a new company of the same name “XPLOIT”, I decided to try to gather talented artists and turn the idea of Egocentrism into a real game, and not just an interesting prototype. I hired several concept artists and illustrators in September 2022 and started working.

First of all, we started creating a new character, working out the plot and scenario of the game. On the wave of motivation, the illustrators gave out dozens of different versions of the main character, environment, backgrounds and ideas about the mechanics of the game, and I did not have time to write down and put everything together. The work was very intense!

Starting from this post, I will keep a developer’s diary and share with you our progress and news about the development of the game.
